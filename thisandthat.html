<h2>Why should LAUSD have more file storage on the school iPads?</h2>
<p>Because students can use the iPads for film projects in film classes and yearbook stuff. More file storage will allow the students to store files from 9th grade up to their senior year, which means more files being stored on the school iPads now and in the future. Why else? When students get their personal devices taken away they have a backup on their school iPad to take holiday photos and videos, especially driving videos like down CA-241 tollway south and other photos on trips they failed to take on their personal device. It also means more photos for senior events at high school if they don't have enough space on a personal device</p>
<h2>Why pop rock music is many times better than classical music </h2>
<p>To begin with, pop rock music is suitable for driving. Why? Because the tempo and melody that it has gets people pumped up and thus gets them to drive faster and will get them so energized particularly when they drive in the carpool lane. This would be more for freeway driving and stuff like that whereas classical would be more for slow, grave drives on streets. Since the tempo of pop rock music is faster, it would resemble highway speeds. Sometimes I feel like driving on a freeway while listening to a song gets me to connect the experience of the song's beat to the speed I am driving at. For example, when I listen to the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWUt8UZunOE">Sunroof by Nicky Youre and Dazy</a> it sounds like driving on CA-241 South (video project scheduled, date unknown at this time). Not to mention that most of the kids at my school love this kind of music and the fact that this is what gets me dancing makes me get more attention from people. Therefore, listening to classical music would kinda get me less attention since it is not what my friends are talking about even though my cousin Nathan and the rest of my family likes it, not to mention Isaac will treat me like a jerk even more.</p>
