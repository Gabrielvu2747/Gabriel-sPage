          <p><font size="+2">The entire Bruch concerto has 3 movements. This one is the second movement. I learned this 2 years ago with my old violin teacher, Mr. Schwabe. We left him mid-2020 to finally study with Ms. Joan Kwuon. It is written in G minor, which was composed in 1866. This is another performance with cellist Nathan Le. Enjoy the show as always!!!</font></p>
