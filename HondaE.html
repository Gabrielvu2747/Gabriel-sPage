<p><font size="+2">This Mini Cooper-like EV is a cute car. It was produced since 2020, but wasn't imported into the US due to fear of disastrous sales. It is fit for urban areas, busy trying to improve the environment. Just like the Mazda MX-30, what is disappointing is that it can only drive 137 miles, which is 37 miles more than the Mazda MX-30. There are 2 model car variants in 1/60 scale, the Matchbox version, where it is available in blue, white, and potentially gray as an exclusive in a 7-pack, and the Tomica version, only available in white. I only have the Tomica version, which is only available in white. What makes it so special is that unlike older cars, it uses camera mirrors so that the driver can see what is going on in their mirrors from inside the car. Some of the newer cars have this but it may only be available in a certain mode.</font></p>
