<p><font size="+2">This is one of my favorite Apple technologies, where note taking and storing data of all kinds, including drawings is stored and taken easily. Let's dive into some of the iPads that existed before and those that exist now, along with their best stylus, the Apple Pencil, which is available in 2 generations. The first gen Pencil connects via Lightning to pair and charge whereas the second gen Pencil charges wirelessly on the right side of the iPad. Note that these are only compatible with certain models. For example, the AP1 is compatible with the mini 5, Air 3, and the iPads 6-10. Note the 10th gen iPad pairs and charges the 1st gen Pencil via the USB-C to Lightning adapter. It even is compatible with the iPad Pros with the lightning connector, not the USB-C. The AP2 is compatible with the Pro 12.9-inch 3-5, and the 11-inch 1-4. As for the non-Pro models, it is supported with the mini 6 and the Air 4 & 5.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">Now with some facts of the iPad, the first generation was made on 01/27/2010. It had no camera whatsoever, until the second gen and up, and all the other versions were made. At that time, it had the Apple A4 chipset with a 9.7" touchscreen display. Lots of positive reviews were generated. Dating back to 1993, the first tablet to be made from Apple was the Newton MessagePad 100. Ever since the first iPad was produced, lots of rumors spread out. The iPads run iPadOS presently, but in the past they ran iOS systems (probably due to the fact that it supports Apple Pencil uses a slightly different version of the iOS system). They then started producing accessories for the iPad, like the headphones and cables required to work with the device to charge and hear the audio from the device. The iPad mini line was made since 2013, the Air since 2014, and the Pro since 2016. The Apple Pencil was designed since 2015 with the present-day iPads being made to have the compatibility with it, which is why older iPad models will not work with the Pencil, as they are from before 2015, where there was absolutely no Apple Pencil at the time. The second gen Pencil was made in 2018.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">As for iPad storage sizes, they first started out with 16GB models, 32Gb, and 64GB models, but as time went by, they started dropping the smaller storage sizes and used some others as the base option. For example, the 16GB and 32Gb were dropped in favor for the current iPads to have 64Gb as the base storage and 256GB to be used. The 128GB has been dropped for all other iPads except for the Pro models, which have it as a base storage option. 64GB exists as the base storage for all other iPads, and 256GB exists as the max for all other iPads. The Pro models go up to 2TB. This is what LAUSD should do for all the school iPads as I have said in <a href="thisandthat.html">this page.</a></font></p>
<p><font size="+2">The current iPad models that exist today are the iPad Pro 12.9 inch 6th gen, the iPad Pro 11-inch 4th gen, the iPad mini 6th gen, the iPad Air 5th gen, and the iPad 9th and 10th generations.</font></p>
