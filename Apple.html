<p><font size="+2">Apple is a technology company that is located in Cupertino, California. It is one of the top 5 tech comanies of all time, with the other 4 being Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. It has existed since 1976. It is one of the world's most valuable brands to ever exist due to a large amount of followers and brand loyalty. In trading, it has totaled $3B. As of 2022, it has 164K employees. The first product of Apple to be ever made was the Apple 1, a typewriter. It was the first device of Apple to be built.</font>

<p><font size="+2">In addition to that, a second product in 1992 was introduced, the PenLite, the first tablet computer to be made. They were going to implement this as a tablet, but this was cancelled because they were releasing the device called the Newton, a digital assistant platform. This is probably what led up the reason why Macs are not 2 in 1 devices, due to the fact that iPads and Apple Pencils already exist.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">After that, Apple introduced their first computer, the iMac, in 1998/05/06. It was very successful as they sold 800K units in the first 5 months to abandon old technology, and then they went to making the first laptop, the iBook, on 1999/07/21. More professional versions of this include the PowerBook G3 and Power Macintosh G3. They started naming the computer the iMac due to the fact that these devices have internet connectivity. Four years after that, Apple released the operating system for it, the Mac OS X, even though it failed since the early 1990s for several years of engineering.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">In 2007, Apple then went on to making mobile devices, like the first iPhone, which was made in 2007 and unveiled at the MacWorld Expo. 270K units were sold over the first 30 hours of production, with an agreement to sell music on the iTunes store and apps on the App Store. 3 years later, the first iPad was introduced, running almost every single one of the same apps on the iPhone. speaking of that, that is one of my favorite Apple devices. After it was introduced, it had 300K units sold on the first day, then it ramped up to 500K units being sold by the end of the first week. In 2011, FaceTime, another way to video call people, was introduced, the same year the iPod was introduced, which was discontinued in May 2022. Seven months after that, Steve Jobs, who was the former CEO of Apple, retired and Tim Cook replaced him.</font></p>
