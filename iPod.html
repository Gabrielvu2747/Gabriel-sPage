<p><font size="+2">The iPod was a portable electronic media player that was sold from 2001-2022. It was the oldest to be discontinued by Apple. The reason why it was discontinued by Apple is because iPhone sales took over those of the iPod, seeing how iPhone users use wireless headphones with their iPhones than their iPods to listen to music. It had storages from 512MB-256GB. These storage sizes go in binary values. The sales of the iPhone took over those of the iPod in 2010. I was planning to get one of those in 2021 but I laid it off and decided not to get one.</font></p>
