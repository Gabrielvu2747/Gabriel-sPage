<p><font size="+2">Since technology is another one of my interests, I wanted to show you some of what I know about technology from everything Apple to MS Windows. I have been into this at a very young age, and I learned how to use technology by playing around with it. My most favorite piece of technology is the Apple iPad, which can be found in the Apple section, then go under iPads.</font></p>
