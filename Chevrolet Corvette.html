<p><font size="+2">Hit the streets with this fast Chevrolet Corvette at its newest! With its acceleration time of 3 seconds from 0-60mph, it is ready for any race against any supercar in the world!</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">In Tomica, there are 2 color versions of this car. The first one is in yellow, which I have, and the second one is in blue, which is the first edition color. There are many variants in the Matchbox brand that produces this model car, but I do not have any of them.</font></p>
