<h1>iMac (desktop computer)</h1>
<p><font size="+2">The iMac is one of the computers that is made by Apple Inc. It is available as a desktop computer and as a laptop, however, the laptop variant is known as the MacBook. Originally, it was built in 1998 with an egg-shaped look. Later on, they changed it to a more professional design, with a stand that can move the monitor back and forth.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">In 2007, the iMac underwent a redesign, sharing the same form as the previous, but they removed the SuperDrive, an optical disk drive that was made by Apple Inc. It even uses a different display unit, with a glass panel protecting the screen. This included faster graphics, better SSD options, and even some wifi cards to be included.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">In 2014, another redesign occurred to the Mac, which had a Retina 5K monitor at a resolution of 5120x2880 pixels. A new processor and a graphics chip were included with new storage options. The newer I/O system was introduced on this Mac, with its screen being 27 inches wide. They even made another revision of the Mac, which is 21.5 inches wide in screen.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">In 2017, the iMac Pro, the workstation version of the iMac to be built, features Xeon processors. It is colored in gray rather than silver, which got discontinued 4 years later. That was when the 24 inch iMac was built, with 7 different colors with a 4.5K retina display. These 7 colors were silver, blue, green, orange, yellow, purple, and pink. These supply the M1 chipset nowadays with Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, with 2 USB ports.</font></p>
