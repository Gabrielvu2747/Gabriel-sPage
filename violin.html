        <h2>My Violin Biography</h2>
        <p>
            <font size="+2">I am a devoted violin player who has been playing since age 4. I first started by playing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star at a young age, still trying until I made a lot of improvements. I studied with many private teachers and attended orchestras. I even went to Suzuki Camp when I was very young, learning Suzuki until around middle school, I would say. I used to go to CSUN to study violin and other places, but currently, I study violin at Colburn. In regards to whom I study with privately, I started with Mrs. Lowe, who is currently deceased, then Mr. K, Mr. McLean, a teacher who young kids really love, Mr. Schwabe, and then Ms. Kwuon. I even participated in orchestras, like Violin and String Ensemble at Colburn. After I took those 2, I went on to String Orchestra. Although I am not studying any music this year, I still take private lessons with the following teachers that I described previously. Other than that, my violin playing has taken me very far!! I wouldn't have gotten to this level without the support of my teachers and my dad, who is always encouraging me to practice correctly.</font>
