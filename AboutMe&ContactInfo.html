<h2>What I Do and Like</h2>
<p> I am a big car fan who always loves collecting diecast cars. I love listening to pop music, especially Xmas music when it comes out on my radio station, KOST 103.5. I also love driving on freeways to explore them and potentially making videos out of them. I also love spending time with my cousins and friends when I have the chance to. Since I also like cars, I draw some of them on my iPad. In summary of that paragraph, I love anything to do with transportation because it really helps people get to the right places. </p>
<p> In combination to my interest for cars, I also love computers and anything to do with technology. This has been my interest since an early age because I saw how good tech can be, particularly iPads. The reason why I love iPads is because it is a replacement for a bunch of different notebooks and school supplies, which saves paper and the planet altogether. For example, iPads would replace notebooks and paper while Apple Pencils would replace separate pens and pencils. It can be a great tool with more storage, especially by the fact that I take tons of photos with my personal iPad. I hope to become an IT guy or a graphic designer one day. I also play the violin during my free time. I have been playing since I was 4 years old. </p>
