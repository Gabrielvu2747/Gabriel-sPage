    <p><font size="+2">This piece, written in 1874 by Edward Lalo, specifically for the violinist Pablo Sarasate, who published Intro and Tarentella, a piece I learned in 2021, is known as a "Spanish Symphony." Although many consider it a violin concerto today, it was designed for orchestra. This is only the first movement out of the 5 movements that exist. It is one of 2 of Lalo's most often played works. The other  one is the Cello Concerto in D minor.</font></p>
