<p><font size="+2">The iPhone, a line of smartphones made by Apple, uses iOS. As described on the main page, the first iPhone was made on 2007/01/09. Every year, a new one is introduced, along with a new iOS to be used with the phones and all mobile devices. All Apple devices eventually end up getting unsupported. To unlock the devices, like the iPad models, they at first used Touch ID, which is a fingerprint authenticator hardware feature, where the user uses their fingerprint to unlock the device. The present-day biometrics authentication is Face ID, where the user has to look at their phone to unlock it. This is a quicker method anyone can use to unlock their device rather than entering their passcode manually, which is not suited for lazy people who can't get their butt off the couch. However, the iPhone SE does not use Face ID, rather, it still uses Touch ID. Not to mention that the SE is the cheapest iPhone, just like the iPad lineup is the cheapest iPad series to exist. It first used the headphone jack for listening to music but was removed for more hardware features and to get people to use AirPods to listen to music to get money out of AirPods sales.</font></p>
