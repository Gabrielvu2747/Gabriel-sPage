          <p><font size="+2">This piece was written by Fritz Kreisler, a very popular violin piece. As shown in the video title on YouTube, it is in the style of Pugnani, where it was ascribed to him. I am accompanied with Nathan Le, who is my cousin, a cellist who is studying and finishing NEC. Enjoy the show!</font></p>
