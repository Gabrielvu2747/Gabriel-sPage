    <p><font size="+2">This song is in the key of E Major, based on the habanera rhythm, used as the main theme of the film "The Ninth Gate". It was premiered in Paris on 1894/01/07. This video will be featuring Ms. Inyung Huh, a pianist who works at Colburn, who is the pianist that I am accompanying as featured in the video. Enjoy the show!!!</font></p>
